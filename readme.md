### Info

I wrote this web scraping program in 2016 for downloading posts from a site and it was never meant to be put up online.

However for show-off purposes this has been uploaded to Github in 2020 just to show how cleanly I write my programs even when no one else is going to look at it.

What this program did originally (note this program should now not work properly after obsfucation):
1) Builds a graphical user interface and where it displays some instructions and asks for username of the blog author
2) User can input a username and press the Download button
3) The button will then start to download and save all of that user's blog posts each into a separate text file with appropriate title and included comments

##### Note: I Modified This To Obsfucate Which Site It Downloaded From

##### Note: This is a very short and easy program to understand compared to some other ones I've written, but it's a good demonstration of how clean in general my coding style is.
